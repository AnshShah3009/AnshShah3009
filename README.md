I'm Ansh Shah, an enthusiast at the intersection of mechanical engineering, physics, and robotics. I graduated from BITS Pilani University (Pilani Campus) with degrees in BE Mechanical Engineering and MSc Physics in May 2023. Currently, I'm immersed in the world of research as a Research Fellow at the Robotics Research Center under the guidance of Professor Madhava Krishna at IIIT Hyderabad.

My research pursuits span the realms of Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Multi-Agent SLAM, with a dash of passion for robotics hardware. My portfolio encompasses foundational projects in deep learning and computer vision. While I'm currently engrossed in mastering reinforcement learning, my excitement lies in bringing these concepts to life within real robotic systems. Notably, I've contributed to a Multi-Agent SLAM pipeline at RRC and am presently engrossed in crafting a loop closure detection module for the SLAM pipeline. Additionally, I'm actively involved in developing a differentiable local planner, further enhancing my expertise.

Here's a glimpse of my ongoing endeavours:
- ðŸ”­ Presently, I'm engrossed in a Language Action Models, Behavious Cloning and Robust Imitation Learning.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm fervently open to collaboration on projects centred around reasoining for robotics, driven by a shared passion for technological innovation.
- ðŸ¤” I'm actively seeking guidance for potential avenues in Master's programs and job/research opportunities within the captivating realm of robotics.
- ðŸ’¬ I'm always up for discussions ranging from books, sports, and philosophy to psychology, art, chess, movies, guitar, technology, and environmental studies.
- âš¡ Fun fact: "Nothing is original. Steal like an Artist."

Feel free to connect with me via email at anshshah3009@gmail.com or f20180917p@alumni.bits-pilani.ac.in. I'm always eager to engage in meaningful conversations.
