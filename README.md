### Hola AmigoðŸ‘‹

I am a Mechinical Engineering student from Bits Pilani University (Pilani Campus).

My broad research interest lies in robotics control domain and reinforcement learning (I also love to work on robotics hardware). I have implemented basic projects in deep learning and computer vision. I am learning reinforcement learning right now and I look forward to it's implementation in real life robots. I am looking forward to learning methods of autonomous navigation ,reinforcement learning.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Project on Quadruped Gait Simulations in Ros2,Gazebo.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning reinforcement learning and it's application in robotics.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on aerial robotics projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with thesis in robotics.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about books, sports, robots, chess, movies, coding, technology, Evs.
