### Hola AmigoðŸ‘‹

I am Ansh Shah

I graduated from BE. Mechanical Engineering and Msc. Physics from BITS Pilani University (Pilani Campus) in May, 2023. I am currently working as a Researh Intern at Robotics Research Center under Professor Madhava Krishna at IIIT Hyderabad.

My broad research interest lies in Deep Learning, Reinforcement learning and Multi-Agent SLAM (I also love to work on robotics hardware). I have implemented basic projects in deep learning and computer vision. I am learning reinforcement learning right now and I look forward to it's implementation in real life robots. I have worked on a Multi Agent SLAM pipeline for RRC and I am currently working on a loop closure detection module for the slam pipeline.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Project on Multi Agent SLAM for Quadcopter, Loop Closure Detection module using DL techniques.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Multi-Agent SLAM using pose graph optimization and Implementation in a Drone Swarm.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on aerial robotics projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Masters, Job/Research-Opportunity in Robotics.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about books, sports, robots, Philosophy and it's sister Psychology, Art, Chess, Movies, Guitar, Technology, Evs.
