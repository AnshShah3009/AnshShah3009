I'm Ansh Shah, an enthusiast at the intersection of mechanical engineering, physics, and robotics. I graduated from BITS Pilani University (Pilani Campus) with degrees in BE Mechanical Engineering and MSc Physics in May 2023. Currently, I'm immersed in the world of research as a Research Intern at the Robotics Research Center under the guidance of Professor Madhava Krishna at IIIT Hyderabad.

My research pursuits span the realms of Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Multi-Agent SLAM, with a dash of passion for robotics hardware. My portfolio encompasses foundational projects in deep learning and computer vision. While I'm currently engrossed in mastering reinforcement learning, my excitement lies in bringing these concepts to life within real robotic systems. Notably, I've contributed to a Multi-Agent SLAM pipeline at RRC and am presently engrossed in crafting a loop closure detection module for the SLAM pipeline. Additionally, I'm actively involved in developing a differentiable local planner, further enhancing my expertise.

Here's a glimpse of my ongoing endeavours:
- üî≠ Presently, I'm engrossed in a Multi-Agent SLAM project tailored for Quadcopters, which involves developing a Loop Closure Detection module utilizing cutting-edge DL techniques.
- üõ§Ô∏è I'm also deeply engaged in building a differentiable local planner, a project that adds a new dimension to my expertise and understanding.
- üå± My current learning trajectory involves diving deep into Multi-Agent SLAM with a focus on pose graph optimization and its practical implementation within a Drone Swarm.
- üëØ I'm fervently open to collaboration on projects centred around aerial robotics, driven by a shared passion for technological innovation.
- ü§î I'm actively seeking guidance for potential avenues in Master's programs and job/research opportunities within the captivating realm of robotics.
- üí¨ I'm always up for discussions ranging from books, sports, and philosophy to psychology, art, chess, movies, guitar, technology, and environmental studies.
- ‚ö° Fun fact: "Nothing is original. Steal like an Artist."
